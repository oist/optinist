transpose: False

standard_mean: True
standard_std: True


labels: 'tbc'
#    int or string
#    Labels of feature axis.
#    If int the corresponding number of labels are selected from the alphabet 'abcde...'
#    --- seems int is not accepted. numbers of characters should match the dimension of the data
join:
#    None or dict
#    Parameter combinations to join
#    If a data set has parametrized by time t and stimulus s, then dPCA will split
#    the data into marginalizations corresponding to 't', 's' and 'ts'. At times,
#    we want to join different marginalizations (like 's' and 'ts'), e.g. if
#    we are only interested in the time-modulated stimulus components. In this case,
#    we would pass {'ts' : ['s','ts']}.

regularizer: 0
#    None, float, 'auto'
#    Regularization parameter. If None or 0, then no regularization is applied.
#    For float, the regularization weight is regularizer*var(data). If 'auto', the
#    optimal regularization parameter is found during fitting (might take some time).


n_components: 8
#    None, int or dict
#    Number of components to keep.
#    If n_components is int, then the same number of components are kept in every
#    marginalization. Otherwise, the dict allows to set the number of components
#    in each marginalization (e.g. {'t' : 10, 'ts' : 5}). Defaults to 10.

copy: True
#    bool
#    If False, data passed to fit are overwritten and running
#    fit(X).transform(X) will not yield the expected results,
#    use fit_transform(X) instead.

n_iter: 0
# int (default: 0)
#    Number of iterations for randomized SVD solver (sklearn).
